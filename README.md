# Predicting customers subscriptions

This project objective is to predict client subscription (or no) to a term deposit, by analyzing a range of factors – demographic, financial, campaign interaction, and economic. 
I pay special attention to the business context of the project, addressing challenges in the initial stages and proposing potential solutions for future activities.

**Business Case:** 

Predicting customers subscription using Classification Models

**Project Overview**

The project uses data from a Portuguese bank collected between 2008 and 2013, which includes a list of call interactions with clients. This dataset contains demographic, behavioral, and economic features, along with the outcome of each call — whether the client accepted the bank’s offer to subscribe to a term deposit or not.

**Objective**

The goal is to develop a classification model to predict potential deposit subscribers, which can be used for further analysis of other bank clients. Additionally, the project aims to create a dataset template that allows the bank’s analytics team to easily download metrics and generate a list of clients likely to subscribe to term deposits.
   
**Project Steps**

1/ Download the dataset and analyze key parameters.  
2/ Review the business context and outline basic requirements for subsequent steps.  
3/ Evaluate the dataset features to determine their relevance for analysis and whether they should be included in the modeling process.  
4/ Perform data cleaning by removing outliers, missing values, and excluding unreliable features.  
5/ Train and test the classification models.  
6/ Develop a prediction tool and create a template dataset for future use by the client.  
7/ Document all details in the corresponding README files.  
8/ Provide final conclusions and recommendations
